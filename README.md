>Our boss likes to play tricks and test our crypto skills, he sent this file and there's a prize to whoever find the hidden message, can you help me.

When downloading this files of challenges , you see you do not have password of compresed folder.

I used the tool (john the ribber) to crack password.

Now, you get access to these files.

You have two files one has the flag which is encrypted and a photo we will use them to get the method of decryption.


The person in this photo is (morgan freeman).


I used the (Steghide) tool to get hidden data from image of (morgan freeman).

 THEN I used Command of Cat to show me details of the extracted file that called (Notes.txt).

 Now, from this text , i know that decryption technique is (Vigenere Decode) and the key is the name of 
 character in the photo ( morgan).



 So now we get the flag.

 That is all.
